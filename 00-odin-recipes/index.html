            <h2>Meals Perfect For A Dreary Fall Day</h2>

            <p>Fall is upon us. The leaves turn bright colors as the world around us seems to chill and prepare for winter.
                With the drop in temperature, people look for select meals to warm them up and bring them comfort as the sun sets
                earlier. Let's look over three cozy meals perfect for bringing some delight into these crisp fall days!
            </p>

            <h2>Chili</h2>
            <img src="/00-odin-recipes/assets/Chili.webp" width="683px">
            <p>Chili is an <strong>excellent</strong> example of a delicious meal that is perfect to combat falling temperatures!
                It's a simple recipe that can be as complex as you wish, but usually comes down to ground beef (or turkey!) and beans.
            Look into our delicious chili recipe <a href="/00-odin-recipes/recipes/chili.html">here</a></p>
            

            <h2>Hamburger Steak with Onions and Gravy</h2>
            <img src="/00-odin-recipes/assets/hamburger-steak.webp">
            <p>Meals that stick to your ribs are also perfect for colder, autumn days. This recipe requires a bit more work
                than a chili, but will most definitely make you happy you made the effort. Hamburger 'steaks' soaked in a hearty
                gravy with onions. It's an amazing meal. Check out the recipe <a href="/00-odin-recipes/recipes/hamburger-steak.html">here</a>

            <h2>Stovetop Hot Cocoa</h2>
            <img src="/00-odin-recipes/assets/hot-cocoa.webp">
            <p> We are finishing with a warm beverage that is sure to be a hit with your family as it is with mine.
                Hot Cocoa is amazing any time of a cold day and can be customized to be the perfect drink you want it to be. While you
                can get it from your local coffee place or as a powder from the store, it's almost always better straight from your stovetop.
                learn how to make it with us <a href="/00-odin-recipes/recipes/hot-cocoa.html">right here.</a>
