        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tasty hamburger "steaks" smothered in gravy and onions. Serve with hot rice or potatoes for an easy-to-make dinner classic.
            It's a great way to dress up a pound of ground beef and you probably have all the ingredients on hand! I love it over homemade
            mashed potatoes, and the gravy really helps. It keeps the family happy and full as the days get colder.
            Hamburger steak is similar to Salisbury steak, which is also made with ground beef. The main difference is that hamburger steak is made with ground beef, while chopped steak is made with ground sirloin. 
            Hamburger steak originated from German sailors who brought Russian steak tartare back to Hamburg, Germany. They originally called it “tartare steak” and later “Hamburg steak”.
            In the early 20th century, vendors began selling Hamburg steak as a sandwich between bread, which is considered the origin of the hamburger.
