        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Hot Cocoa can most definitely knock the cold out of our Autumn and Winter months! It's a staple that is made a lot in my household.
           Originally from Mexico, people have been enjoying drinking chocolate since around 500 bc.<br> The Mayans made a far different
           version than the one we enjoy, using ground up cocoa seeds mixed with water, cornmeal, chili peppers, and even other ingredients.<br>
           We all know hot chocolate as the warm, rich drink we enjoy on a cold night by the fire, or after engaging in winter activities such as ice skating and skiing.
           Hopefully your family can enjoy this simple recipe as well as mine does!
