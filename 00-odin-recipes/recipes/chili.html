        <p>Chili is a good, hearty meal that is perfect for colder temperatures. It's also incredibly
            easy to make. Let's take a look at how to whip some up.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>One Pound Ground Beef</strong><br>
            <p>A medium blend beef works, but you can opt for even ground turkey if you'd prefer.</p></li>
            
            <li><strong>One Onion (diced)</strong><br>
            <p>The size is entirely up to your preferences. I aim for a medium sized onion.</p></li>

            <li><strong>One (15oz) Can of Tomato Sauce</strong></li><br>

            <li><strong>One (15 oz) Can of Kidney Beans</strong></li><br>

            <li><strong>One and 1/2 Cups of Water, or As Needed. (Not Required)</strong></li><br>

            <li><strong>One Teaspoon Chili Powder (or To Taste)</strong></li><br>

            <li><strong>One Pinch of Garlic Powder</strong></li><br>

            <li><strong>Salt and Pepper to Taste</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Steps </h2>

        <p>Throwing it together is simple and doesn't require much prepwork. </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Add ground beef and onion to a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir meat until it is browned and
                the onions are tender. Usually 5 - 7 minutes.
            </li><br><br>

            <li>Stir in tomato sauce, kidney beans, and stewed tomatoes with juice.
                If you prefer a thinner consistency, you can add water. Season with chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper.<br>
                Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and let simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
