        <p>Chili is a good, hearty meal that is perfect for colder temperatures. It's also incredibly
            easy to make. Let's take a look at how to whip some up.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>One Pound Ground Beef</strong><br>
            <p>A medium blend beef works, but you can opt for even ground turkey if you'd prefer.</p></li>
            
            <li><strong>One Onion</strong><br>
            <p>The size is entirely up to your preferences. I aim for a medium sized onion.</p></li>

            <li><strong>One (15oz) Can of Tomato Sauce</strong></li><br>

            <li><strong>One (15 oz) Can of Kidney Beans</strong></li><br>

            <li><strong>One and 1/2 Cups of Water, or As Needed. (Not Required)</strong></li><br>

            


        </ul>
